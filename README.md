## Reflection

This was a 4 days long project built during my technical test for the Front-End Developer position. Project goals development of a web game application responsive using react Javascript, redux-saga, scss and JSON-server. 
 

Managing time was my biggest challenge in this project because I was working on another at the same time.

At the end of the project, the technologies implemented was Javascript, React, React-Router, Redux-saga, LoDash, anted, and a significant amount of VanillaJS and scss for the front-end part. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
For the back-end part i used json-server.


In the next iteration the front-end part could be optimized on different devices and the application will became better after adding first loading and some other features like registration, forgot password and others.

Adding unit test is needed to make sure all the project is working without problems.
